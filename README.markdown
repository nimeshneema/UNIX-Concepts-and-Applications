This project compiles solutions for the **"Flex Your Brain"** exercises found at the end of each chapter in the book [UNIX: Concepts and Applications, Fourth Edition][book], authored by **Sumitabha Das**.

The book is a widely recommended text in Computer Science, Computer Applications, and Information Technology courses across Indian universities. It is particularly popular among students learning UNIX or GNU/Linux.

The **"Flex Your Brain"** exercises are often challenging, and official solutions are not publicly available. This project aims to serve as a valuable study aid for students.

All exercise solutions have been developed and thoroughly tested on computers running:

-   [macOS Sequoia (version 15)][macOS], a POSIX-compliant UNIX operating system developed by Apple.

-   [Ubuntu Desktop Linux 25.04 (Plucky Puffin)][ubuntu], a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution.

Both systems utilize [GNU Bash][bash] version 5.2 as the chosen shell.

Every effort has been made to ensure the correctness and completeness of these solutions, taking into account differences between the two platforms. However, it is always recommended to consult official documentation for commands (e.g., using **man** or **info** pages, or online help).

## Conventions Used

1. Command, program name, key term:

    **bold**

2. Command-line and option(s) thereof, user input, expression, symbol:

    `code span`

3. Command output, script, source code:

    ```
    code block
    ```

4. File/folder name, path:

    _"italicized inside double quote"_

5. String:

    "double quote"

6. Domain name, email address, URL:

    _italicized_

## Notes

-   macOS Big Sur 11.0 and later versions are compatible with both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Recent Bash versions are compiled natively for both architectures, and all command lines in the solutions have been tested to work on both.

-   Ubuntu Desktop Linux is available for both Intel x86_64 and ARM64 architectures, and all command lines in the solutions have been tested to work on both.

-   Linux is not a replacement for UNIX. Ubuntu Linux was chosen as the distribution for this project due to its widespread adoption and ease of use.
