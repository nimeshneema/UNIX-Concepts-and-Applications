# Chapter 3 - General-Purpose Utilities

1.  By running the command-line: `date +"%d-%m-%y/%H:%M:%S"`

2.  An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that does not represent the character itself, but a different character that's not possible to be entered directly in the given context. It is generally a two character-sequence beginning with a backslash (**\\**) character.

    Three escape sequences used by `echo` command, with their significance are:

    -   `\n`: Represents newline character.

    -   `\b`: Represents backspace character.

    -   `\\`: Represents backslash character.

3.  1.  Supply `-e` option to the `echo` command. The modified command-line is: `echo -e "Filename: \c"`

    2.  Supply `-n` option to the `echo` command. The modified command-line is: `echo -n "Filename: \c"`

4.  There are a couple of mistakes in the command line:

    -   As per the syntax of `printf` command, it is invalid to supply a comma character between arguments.

    -   `fname` needs to be evaluated as a variable and should be preceded by `$` character.

    The corrected command-line is: `printf "Filename: %s\n" $fname`

5.  1.  Convert 192 to octal by executing the following `bc` internal commands:

        `obase=8`

        `192`

        Convert 192 to hexadecimal by executing the following `bc` internal commands:

        `obase=16`

        `192`

    2.  Convert 192 to octal and hexadecimal by executing the following command line:

        `printf "The value of 192 in octal is %o and hexadecimal is %x\n" 192 192`

        `bc` command can be used to display the number in binary by setting `obase=2`.

6.  Running `script` command spawns a new sub-shell process.

7.  `mailx` command can obtain its arguments via shell variables or at runtime using piping and redirection. It can work non-interactively and can also be automated via scripting.

8.  When a new email message is received, it is stored in a file referred to as _mailbox_. Once the email message is read, it automatically moves to a file named _mbox_ which is generally stored in the user's home directory.

9.  To hide the keyboard input from getting displayed on the terminal execute: `stty -echo`

    The above setting can be reversed by executing: `stty echo`

10. By identifying the machine by determining its hostname obtained from executing the command-line: `uname -n`

11. By examining the output of the command-line: `stty -a`

    and reading values corresponding to `erase`, `kill` and `eof` keys.

12. By setting `Control + c` key sequence corresponding to **kill** keyword using `stty` command as: `stty kill \^c`

    No, the setting doesn't persist between login sessions.

    (Note that both macOS and Linux have the said key sequence set for interruption by default and need not be set explicitly.)
