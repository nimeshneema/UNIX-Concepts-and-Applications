# Chapter 08 - The Shell

01. The shell performs all the actions represented by the metacharacters before executing the command line.

    After completing the pre-processing step consisting of:

    01. **Parsing**: Breaking up the command line into individual, meaningful words (tokens).

    02. **Variable Evaluation**: Evaluating the values of all the **$** prefixed items.

    03. **Command Substitution**: Executing the command line enclosed in backticks, and substituting their output.

    04. **Redirection**: Looking for redirection operations and opening appropriate files.

    05. **Wild-card Interpretation**: Interpreting wildcard characters and making appropriate substitutions.

    06. **PATH evaluation**: Traversing directories listed in the PATH variable to locate the command file.

    the shell submits the command line to the kernel for final execution.

---

02. (i). `{foo[12],Foo5}`

    (ii). `quit.[coh]`

    (iii). `{watch.{htm,HTML},Watch.html}`

    (iv). `.*.swp`

---

03. (i). `[0-9]?*[!A-Za-z]`

    (ii). `[!.]??*`

    (iii). `?*2004*?`

---

04. (i). A filename comprising of at least 5 characters, where the first character is an alphabet or one of the `[`, `\`, `]`, `^`, `_` or `` ` `` characters.

    (ii). A filename comprising of at least one numeric character.

    (iii). A filename which doesn't end with a numeric character.

    (iv). A non-hidden filename with two character extension where the first character is not **s**, the second character is not **h** and the extension is not **.sh**.

---

05. `cp chap{0[1-9],1[0-9],2[0-6]} ../`

    Yes, a single wild-card pattern can match all the files.

---

06. The first command lists all the hidden files in the current directory. If there are any hidden sub-directories, their contents are listed.

    The second command lists all the non-hidden files in the current directory whose name ends with a dot. If there are any non-hidden sub-directories, their contents are listed.

---

07. The said file and directory can be removed by executing the following command line:

    `rm -rf "*" "My Documents"`

---

08. Single and double quoting suppresses the special meaning of meta-characters and treats them literally. Double quoting is preferred when shell variable evaluation or command substitution is desired within the quoted string.

---

09. In the first command line, the `wc` command opens the file named _foo_ and displays the count of lines, words and bytes in the file on the standard output.

    In the second command line, the `wc` command reads the stream input coming from the file _foo_ and displays the count of lines, words and bytes in the file on the standard output.

    The command `wc` opens the file in the former case and the shell opens the file in the latter.

---

10. By executing the following command line:

    `cat foo1 - foo2`

    The contents of file _foo1_ will be displayed on the terminal, and the shell will wait for user input from the keyboard. Once the input from the keyboard is made, and the same is terminated with an end-of-file character, the contents of the file _foo2_ will be displayed on the terminal, and the prompt returned subsequently.

---

11. (i). The contents of the file _foo_ are overwritten by the text entered via the standard input.

    (ii). The file named _foo_ is created anew, and the output of the command `who` is appended to it.

    (iii). The file _foo_ is blanked out.

    (iv). The contents of the file _foo_ are replaced by a single newline `\n` character.

---

12. The file _newlist_ is present in the list of files along with other files listed as an output of `ls` command. The file _newlist_ finds its way into the list as the shell opens the file before `ls` command comes into action.

---

13. A file descriptor is a unique integer number assigned to an open file by the UNIX kernel.

    `2>` is used as the redirection symbol for standard error because **2** is the default file descriptor for the Standard Error stream.

---

14. The error message is thrown not by the `cat` command, but by the shell. Any error thrown by the `cat` command will be redirected to the file _bar_. Here the command doesn't get to act as the shell fails to locate the file _foo_, hence the error.

---

15. Three conditions need to be satisfied here:

    01. `prog1` should be able to write to the Standard Output.

    02. `prog2` should be able to read from the Standard Input, and write to the Standard Output.

    03. `prog3` should be able to read from the Standard Input.

---

16. A count of number of logged in users can be obtained by executing the following command line:

    `who | wc -l`

---

17. (i). Use the following command line to print the calendar of the current month using command substitution:

    `echo "$(cal)"`

    (ii). Use the following command line to print a listing of a group of filenames stored in a file:

    `echo "$(cat list)"`

---

18. (i). The total size of all the C source files (in bytes) can be stored in a variable named **count** by executing the following command line:

    `count=$(cat *.c | wc -c)`

    (ii). Assuming that the file is named _foo.c_, the total number of lines can be stored in a variable named **count** by executing the following command line:

    `count=$(cat foo.c | wc -l)`

---

19. By executing the command line:

    `count="$(cat `cat foo` | wc -m)"`

    First of all `cat foo` is expanded which lists all the file names. Further invocation of `cat` writes to Standard Output, the contents of all the files listed from the last step. The Standard Output from this step is piped to the `wc` command, which counts the total number of characters using `-m` option and the resulting value is assigned to the **count** variable.
