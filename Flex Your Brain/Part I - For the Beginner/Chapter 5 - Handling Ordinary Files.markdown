# Chapter 5 - Handling Ordinary Files

1.  A directory is technically a file containing the name and the inode number of files and sub-directories that it contains. The entries are updated by the kernel on the user's behalf when files and sub-directories are added, renamed or deleted.

    The size of a directory file is usually small as it doesn't store the files and subdirectories it contains, just their name and inode numbers.

2.  The former command displays the contents of the file named _foo_ present in the current directory.

    The latter command returns a secondary prompt and lets the user type any text. Upon encountering the end-of-file (`Control + d`) character, the entered text is saved in a file named _foo_ in the current directory.

    Use of `Control + d` is required when entering the text from standard input to let the shell know that the text entry is over.

3.  (i). Yes, the command would work. The file _foo_ would be copied into the directory named _bar_.

    (ii). No, the command won't work. An error message is displayed stating that _foo_ is a directory and is not copied.

4.  The first command will delete the directory _bar_ along with all the files and sub-directories recursively, disregarding the write protection status of any files or sub-directory and non-emptiness of any sub-directory.

    The second command will work only when the directory _bar_ is empty and its parent directory (current directory here) is not write-protected.

5.  (i). The file or directory named _include_ present in the logged-in user's home directory is moved to the current working directory.

    (ii). The command recursively copies the contents of _bar1_ to _bar2_. If _bar2_ exists and is a directory, recursively copy contents of _bar1_ into _bar2_, thus making a copy of _bar1_ a sub-directory of _bar2_.

    (iii). The command moves all the files and directories in the current directory into a directory named _bin_ in the parent directory.

6.  The three possible reasons can be:

    (i). Read permission is not available for the file _hosts_.

    (ii). Write permission is not available for the file _backup/hosts.bak_.

    (iii). Execute permission is not available for the directory _backup_.

7.  By executing the following command line:

    `cd ; mv a temp ; mv temp/a . ; rmdir temp`

    Individual commands in the above command line are described below:

    -   `cd`: Changes the working directory to the user's home directory.

    -   `mv a temp`: Rename the directory _a_ under home directory to _temp_.

    -   `mv temp/a .`: Move the directory hierarchy _a_ under _temp_ directory to the home directory.

    -   `rmdir temp`: Remove the directory named _temp_.

8.  Using the repeat factor, an internal command within `more` command can be made to run multiple times.

    Type `/include` to locate the first occurrence of the pattern. Continue pressing the key `n` to repeat the search for further occurrences.

    Using the repeat factor a command can be executed for a set number of times. The dot command on the other hand simply repeats the last command once.

9.  We can ensure that the file is indeed a Postscript file by executing `file` command with the filename as an argument and checking for the file type information.

    Postscript files are properly formatted for input to a Postscript printer.

10. (i). We can count the number of filenames by executing the command line:

    `wc -l < foo`

    which outputs the total number of lines in the file _foo_.

    (ii). By displaying the octal dump of the files contents by executing:

    `od -bc foo`

    and checking for the presence of space character in the output.

11. DOS and UNIX text files differ by using different line ending characters. DOS uses a combination of **carriage return** and **line feed** characters (**\r\n**), whereas, UNIX uses **line feed** (**\n**) as the line ending character.

    `dos2unix` command converts a text file from DOS format to UNIX format by removing the extra carriage return characters from the places where the line ending character combination occurs.

    `unix2dos` command reverses the process by appending the carriage return character before every occurrence of the line feed character.

12. The desired list can be created by executing the command line:

    `comm -13 foo1 foo2`

    which will list the entries unique to the file _foo2_. The command will not work properly when the files are unsorted, or the files contains more than one name per line.

13. To add the two files to an archive and compress it, execute the command line:

    `tar -cvf archive.tar foo.html bar.html ; gzip archive.tar`

    The compressed archive will be saved as _archive.tar.gz_. To delete the original files execute:

    `rm foo.html bar.html`

    To reverse the process, uncompress and unarchive the files by executing the command line:

    `tar -xvf archive.tar.gz`

    This can be followed by deleting the compressed archive by running the command:

    `rm archive.tar.gz`

    to completely reverse the process.

14. The three advantages of using **zip** over **gzip** are:

    -   zip files can be handled easily both in Windows and UNIX.

    -   zip combines archiving and compressing under a single command.

    -   zip command provides facility to add/append files to an existing compressed archive.

    To compress and archive a directory hierarchy to send via email execute:

    `zip -r archive.zip direcotry_path`

    The recipient can easily recreate the directory structure by executing:

    `unzip archive.zip`

15. A command behaves recursively when it can descent a directory hierarchy and execute over all the files, sub-directories and files thereof.

    Examples of commands which support recursive operation are:

    -   `cp -R`: Recursively copies a directory hierarchy.

    -   `ls -R`: Recursively lists files in a directory hierarchy.

    -   `rm -r`: Recursively deletes files in a directory hierarchy.

    -   `zip -r`: Recursively compress and archives a directory hierarchy.
